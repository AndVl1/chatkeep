# Fixtures Directory

This directory contains JSON fixture files generated by the backend CI pipeline.

Fixtures are used for contract testing to ensure frontend and backend schemas remain compatible.

## How it works:

1. Backend generates fixture files during CI (e.g., `channel_reply_response.json`)
2. CI copies fixtures to this directory
3. Frontend contract tests verify they can deserialize the fixtures
4. If tests fail, it means backend changed the schema incompatibly

## Running without fixtures:

Contract tests are skipped if fixtures don't exist. To generate fixtures:

```bash
# From backend directory
./gradlew generateFixtures
```

Then copy the generated files to this directory.
